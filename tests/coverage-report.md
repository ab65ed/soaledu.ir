## Coverage Trends

### Historical Coverage Data
```
Date       | Frontend | Backend | E2E | Overall
-----------|----------|---------|-----|--------
2024-01-01 | 0%       | 0%      | 0%  | 0%
```

### Coverage Goals by Sprint
- **Sprint 1**: Achieve 60% coverage on core modules
- **Sprint 2**: Achieve 70% coverage with E2E tests
- **Sprint 3**: Achieve 80% coverage target
- **Sprint 4**: Maintain 80%+ coverage with new features

## Uncovered Code Analysis

### Critical Uncovered Areas

## Coverage Exclusions

### Intentionally Excluded Files
```
# Frontend exclusions
frontend/src/pages/_app.jsx
frontend/src/pages/_document.jsx
frontend/src/pages/api/**
frontend/src/lib/queryClient.jsx
frontend/src/store/index.jsx
frontend/src/**/*.test.{js,jsx}
frontend/src/**/*.spec.{js,jsx}
frontend/src/test-utils/**
frontend/src/**/__tests__/**

# Backend exclusions
backend/src/server.js
backend/src/config/**
backend/tests/**
backend/test-utils/**
backend/src/**/*.test.js
backend/src/**/*.spec.js
```

### Exclusion Rationale
- **Configuration Files**: No business logic to test
- **Test Files**: Self-referential testing not needed
- **Entry Points**: Minimal logic, mostly imports
- **Development Tools**: Not part of production code

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. ✅ **Set up Jest configuration** for both frontend and backend - **COMPLETED**
2. ✅ **Create test utilities** for consistent testing patterns - **COMPLETED**
3. **Write unit tests** for core business logic - **IN PROGRESS**
4. **Implement integration tests** for API endpoints - **PENDING**
5. **Add E2E tests** for critical user flows - **PENDING**

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Add visual regression testing** with Percy or similar
2. **Implement performance testing** with Lighthouse CI
3. **Add accessibility testing** with axe-core
4. **Set up mutation testing** with Stryker
5. **Integrate coverage reporting** with CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term Goals
1. **Achieve 90%+ coverage** on critical business logic
2. **Implement property-based testing** for complex algorithms
3. **Add contract testing** for API integrations
4. **Set up chaos engineering** for resilience testing
5. **Implement automated security testing**

## How to Generate This Report

### Manual Generation
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage:report

# Open HTML coverage report
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

### Automated Generation
This report should be automatically updated:
- After each test run in CI/CD
- Before each release
- Weekly for trend analysis

### Coverage Badge Integration
Add coverage badges to README.md:
```markdown
[![Frontend Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Frontend-0%25-red)](./tests/coverage-report.md)
[![Backend Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/Backend-0%25-red)](./tests/coverage-report.md)
[![E2E Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/E2E-0%25-red)](./tests/coverage-report.md)
```

## Notes

- Testing framework infrastructure is now complete and functional
- Coverage percentages will be automatically updated as tests are implemented
- Current 0% coverage reflects that only basic test infrastructure exists
- Focus on meaningful tests rather than just achieving percentage targets
- All test commands are working correctly and ready for development
