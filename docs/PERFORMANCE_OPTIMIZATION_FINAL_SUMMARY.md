## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Performance Utilities
```javascript
// Optimized question pagination
const { questions, hasNext, hasPrev } = paginateQuestions(allQuestions, 5, currentPage);

// Batch component loading
await lazyLoadComponents([
  () => import('./Component1'),
  () => import('./Component2'),
  () => import('./Component3')
], 3);
```

### Image Optimization
```javascript
// Canvas-based preview optimization
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
const maxWidth = 400;
const ratio = Math.min(maxWidth / img.width, maxWidth / img.height);
canvas.width = img.width * ratio;
canvas.height = img.height * ratio;
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```

### Database Optimization
```javascript
// Strategic indexing for performance
resultSchema.index({ user: 1, exam: 1 }, { unique: true });
resultSchema.index({ exam: 1, completedAt: -1 });
resultSchema.index({ percentage: -1 });
```
